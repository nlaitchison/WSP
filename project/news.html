							<h4> Old Man Markley out today! </h4>
						</header>
						<p> L.A. bluegrass punks Old Man Markley’s latest full length, Down Side Up, is out today! The album features thirteen tracks that blur the lines between bluegrass, country, and punk. Take a look at what CMT Edge had to say. A first for us, it isn’t often we get a nod from the country circuit. Beginning today, head over to Spinner to stream Down Side Up in its entirety. Produced by Fat Mike and singer Johnny Carey, the album is a cohesive, foot tapping good time. Order it here, view their tour dates and enter this contest!</p>

							<h4> New Morning Glory 7" in May!</h4>
						</header>
						<p> We thought it fitting to release a winter themed 7” in the spring since Morning Glory encapsulate so many of the tenets of warmth and cold. They’re punks after all, yet they have a sweet uplifting side which you can hear in the heavily piano-laden song Care of Me from 2012’s full length, Poets Were My Heroes. This spring we’ll release the Born to December single, the a-side also culled from Poets Were My Heroes, backed with two previously unreleased songs. These East Coast punkers are gearing up to jump the pond on an extensive tour of Europe and just completed filming an epic video for “Born to December” which we’ll be premiering soon. In the meantime, read what Ezra from MG had to say about the release below:</p>
