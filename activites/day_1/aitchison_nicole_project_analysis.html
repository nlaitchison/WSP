				<h2> Targeted Audience</h2>
					<p>The audience for FatWreck.com consists of 18-34 year old males with some college to no college and no kids, according to Alexa.com. Most of them would have a lot of experience with technology, especially with smart phones. They would mainly listen to punk, post-hardcore, hardcore and metal music. Skateboarding and playing instruments would most likely be 2 of their main interests. A lot of them would also be in bands that are interested in being signed by big record labels. </p>
				<h4> Austin Carter - High School Student / Music Enthusiast</h4>
					<p>Austin Carter is an 18 year old high school student from Houston, Texas. He works at the Van’s store in the local mall. He’s extremely dedicated to his music scene, so he spends all the money he has on concert tickets and band merch. Austin always checks up on his favorite record labels websites to find out about tour dates, merch and new bands, but sometimes it can be hard to find new information. He wants a website that will keep him up to date and be interesting. One where he can listen to new bands and easily see tour dates/be linked to the bands actual sites. </p>
				<h4> Craig Mullins - Local Band Member</h4>
					<p>Craig Mullins is a 22 year old guitar player who only took one year of college before quitting to pursue his dream of music. He’s in a local band that’s trying to get signed. At the moment he has to look up all the record labels, find out their policy on demos and then find their email address or street address to send them his demo. He would love it if labels actually had a demo form that could be filled out on the website and sent to the label with the exact information that is needed.This would not only make his life and a bunch of band’s lives easier, it would also improve the efficiency of the demo process. The demos could be easily narrowed down with the form answers.</p>
